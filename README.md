> *"Where bugs become features, and coders become legends."*  

Welcome to **Codoko Club**, the official coding community of ABSS Institute of Technology, Meerut!  
We’re a bunch of curious humans who believe in learning, building, and sometimes accidentally breaking stuff (don’t worry, we fix it… eventually 🛠️).  

---

## ✨ What We Do
- 💻 **Coding Jams** – Write code, break code, fix code. Repeat.  
- 🎯 **Events & Workshops** – From "Hello World" to hackathons.  
- 🚀 **Projects** – Because what’s cooler than shipping something that *actually works*?  
- 🧠 **DSA Practice** – Fighting arrays and trees like warriors.  
- 🤝 **Collaboration** – Teamwork makes the dream (and the repo) work.
